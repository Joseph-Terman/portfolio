          <p>
            While studying to receive my Masters Degree in Cybersecurity from
            UMBC, I found myself obsessed with all things mobile and IoT
            related. I took it upon myself to learn how to code in Swift,
            understand MVC and MVVM formats, and discover the limitations of
            security within the language and devices.
          </p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <h5>Skills learned from school</h5>
          <p>
            I maintained a 4.0 GPA during the entirety of my Masters Program
            despite having very little related knowledge going into the program.
            Some of the notable skills related to iOS that I learned whilst in
            my program are shown below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Waterfall Lifecycle
            </li>
            <li>
              Importance of security testing
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Policies
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Compliance Auditing
            </li>

          <h3>Thesis</h3>
          <h5>Mobile and IoT Security</h5>
          <p>
            My thesis involved the research and discussion of threats and
            vulnerabilities related to the communication between a home security
            IoT device and its iOS mobile app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had ultimately discovered several ways to interrupt communication
            between the device and the app thus rendering the device useless.
            Ultimately, I was able to build a simple mobile app that allowed the
            user to monitor the IoT device and determine when the device had
            gone offline.

          <h3>Hobbies and Post Grad Life</h3>
          <h5>Staying Afloat</h5>
          <p>
            I consider myself to be a fast and dedicated self-learner. I was
            able to teach myself how to troubleshoot mechanical issues on
            vintage Harley Davidson motorcycles and began to fix up old bikes to
            sell for profit. One thing lead to another and I was able to
            complete a few ground-up builds and enjoy how badass transportation
            felt before my time.
